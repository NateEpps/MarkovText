This is the age of descent
The fresh faced generation of defect
It's gotta come down before we reach for the reset
This is for the lost, downtrodden and rejects
And anybody looking for a purpose
We all kick our way through streets of grey
Some find hope in a TV screen
But nobody has an answer for anything
And no one can seem to agree

And then the 8 Ball said “things don't look great”
You know we can't break loose if we stay in place
Every earthquake starts with a little shake
And then we'll see who is standing in the wasteland

It's just a matter of opinion when it comes down to it
To tell the truth I never listen, just grit my teeth and split
It's just a matter of opinion when it comes down to it
But no one ever fucking listens
Yeah no one ever fucking listens
So you can take your damn opinion and fucking suck it

And then the 8 Ball said “things don't look great”
You know we can't break loose if we stay in place
Every earthquake starts with a little shake
And then we'll see who is standing in the wasteland

And then the 8 Ball said “things don't look great”
You know we can't break loose if we stay in place
Every earthquake starts with a little shake
And then we'll see who is standing in the wasteland

And then the 8 Ball said “things don't look great”
You know we can't break loose if we stay in place
Every earthquake starts with a little shake
And then we'll see who is standing in the wasteland

"Fuck Neck Deep mate, they're shit. Ben's dad owns a record label."

I've had a steady stream of lonely nights
For the past few weeks in this room
I'm locked away from it all
Just need a break from the walls that close me in
I'll see this out standing on pins
I'll fall asleep with my eyes open
Just to see if I could focus
On something more than my loneliness
None of my friends seem to give a shit about the way I am
I know full well they understand that
I get myself way too deep in what she said
But they'll bail me out when I'm in over my head

I'm getting sick of being broke
But what's worse is I'm all on my own
Can't seem to let this go
I wish I could stop staring at the phone so I can get some sleep
Another day, another week in hell
I'll see your face down here real soon
A welcome home to a swift farewell

Of all the things I hope to keep:
A childhood sense of opportunity
Grab life by the wrist and jump
Take the chance while I'm still young and dumb

Passed out but on my feet
With years ahead to get some sleep
And so much time to face defeat
So write our names in wet concrete
To seal our place in space and time
Before we have to walk the line
Before we all move on in life
Before the sun comes up tonight

I'm getting sick of being broke
But what's worse is I'm all on my own
Can't seem to let this go
I wish I could stop staring at the phone so I can get some sleep
Another day, another week in hell
I'll see your face down here real soon
A welcome home to a swift farewell

I'm getting sick of being broke
But what's worse is I'm all on my own
Can't seem to let this go
I wish I could stop staring at the phone so I can get some sleep
Another day, another week in hell
I'll see your face down here real soon
A welcome home to a swift farewell

The golden groves are lined with affluence and roses
But the bagheads down by Central Station
Are closer to where home is
It can be grim and send you West from time to time
Yeah, this place is such a shipwreck
But this shipwreck, it is mine

Day by day, we grew to love this place
And where I make my grave, my anchor lays

I've been wasting away
But in a town with no way out
There's not much else to do anyway
If you're looking for a place to decay
Then there will always be a place in my town called revelry

I've seen a punch or two, narrowly escaped a few
And if you can get the day off, I could show you a view
I remember the football games
The first time that I got laid
And the time J broke his finger drinking by the lake
 
Day by day, we grew to love this place
And where I make my grave is where my anchor lays
The sound of my youth echoes out through these empty streets
I guess I can't kick up the roots;
It's home, and that's the truth

I've been wasting away
But in a town with no way out
There's not much else to do anyway
If you're looking for a place to decay
Then there will always be a place in my town called revelry

We know what it's like to be put down
So fuck you to the world, and stand your ground
We know how to turn it inside out and get a little bit rowdy
We know what it's like to be put down
So fuck you to the world, and stand your ground
We know how to turn it inside out and get a little bit rowdy

I've been wasting away
But in a town with no way out
There's not much else to do anyway
If you're looking for a place to decay
Then there will always be a place in my town called revelry

I'm not stuck, I'm staying
Yeah I said, I'm not stuck, I'm staying
And if you've got sorrows to drown
And the bottom's where you're bound
You will always have a place in my town called revelry

Sit still in the cold of February
Hold my hand in the cemetery and you'll be safe
And I know that this is only temporary
And I don't think that it's helping anything

And it's all fun and games until someone gets fucked up
This will end in tears I could never be enough for you
Count my blessings on one hand and my curses on the other
I let you slip between my fingers

Hide away until the summer

Kali Ma lean over me
Rip your hand into my chest
Pull out my beating heart for the world to see
Then send me down to hell
You ignore my pleas
Indiana couldn't save me so I guess I'll save myself

We hopped from bench to bench in the middle of our town
Where the streetlights hit your eyes and then the tears came falling down
The love that you confessed, the product of your loneliness
I see right through you but what do I do?

Of course I fall for it just like I did when I was sixteen
Such a fool for you
Did you ever even miss me? (Doubt it)

Kali Ma lean over me
Rip your hand into my chest
Pull out my beating heart for the world to see
Then send me down to hell
You ignore my pleas
Indiana couldn't save me so I guess I'll save myself
Kali Ma lean over me
Rip your hand into my chest
Pull out my beating heart for the world to see
Oh won't you go to hell? (Go to hell)

(You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory)
Maybe I, maybe I will (but not today!)

I've been stuck in the middle pages
Hung up on a cross that I created
Built out of the bones that I've been breaking
The sign you said you needed
Is there but you can't see it
You might be down and out but you're still breathing

If you write the story
You'll find out we're all stuck on the same page

Cause sometimes things will bend you
But trust me you'll be fine
Cause I've been moving mountains that I once had to climb
And life's not out to get you
Despite the things you've been through
Cause what you give is what you get
And it doesn't make sense to make do

The walls are caving in again
Happens every now and then
Always got me feeling like I'm fucked (fuck)
Falling in and out of bed sleep so hard
Feel like I'm dead
Trying to get a grip is kinda rough
Say life has lost its meaning
And that's true if you believe it
But someday you will stand above your demons
(You're not beneath this)
 
If you write the story
You'll find out we're all stuck on the same page

Cause sometimes things will bend you
But trust me you'll be fine
Cause I've been moving mountains that I once had to climb
And life's not out to get you
Despite the things you've been through
Cause what you give is what you get
And it doesn't make sense to make do

So pick yourself up
You can't change what's been
You must go on
And learn while you live
And when you see the signs saying hope is up ahead
Then you're right on track for a better end

Cause sometimes things will bend you
But trust me you'll be fine
Cause I've been moving mountains that I once had to climb
And life's not out to get you
Despite the things you've been through
Cause what you give is what you get
Yeah, life's not out to get you
Yeah, life's not out to get you

It's been a few days since I saw you last
And there's a few things that I have to ask
And so the first is, do I hold you back?
And did I fuck up too many times?
Found the bad I know you'd find
And just need some time and space
We've fallen out of place
But I pray to God we don't lose connection
Just need to see you smile or maybe stay awhile
Before we lose all sense of direction

Is it too late to say, too late to say
That I'm sorry for the things I do?
I'm missing you like shit today
And as the world spins on its axis
Seems like it's brought me back here
To say, “Oh God, not this again”

And I haven't seen you smile this whole time
It bums me out and makes me wonder why I can't do right
And I'm trying my best, I promise
And I want this as long as you want it
You asked me where we could meet
I found you there at Lime Street
One cig left in the packet
Stood shy in your dad's jacket
A moment I'll always keep
Oh, take me back to Lime Street
I swear to God you save me
Oh, I swear to God you save me

Is it too late to say, too late to say
That I'm sorry for the things I do?
I'm missing you like shit today
And as the world spins on its axis
Seems like it's brought me back here
To say, “Oh God, not this again”

Is it too late to say, too late to say
That I'm sorry for the things I do?
I'm missing you like shit today
And as the world spins on its axis
Seems like it's brought me back here
To say, “Oh God, not this again”

Is it too late to say, too late to say
Is it too late to say, too late to say
Is it too late to say, too late to say
I swear to God you save me
I swear to God you save me

Don't get too close
That place is haunted
Fear not the ghosts
Cause she sent them running

She sleeps beneath the surface
Consorting with the serpents
She strikes without a purpose

A dark face in a corridor
Deceptively beautiful
She's watching you
She's in everything you do
Her kiss it tastes so sweet
But left me with a lethargy
I couldn't shake, I made a grave mistake

I gave her my heart, she didn't want it
Took it anyway and put a dark spell on it
Since then I haven't been the same
Needed a victim and she got it
Took me in with her song, powerless to stop it
Some men don't dare to speak her name

She picked me up from my decline
Healed my wounds with love and wine
Dosed me up and closed my eyes
A taste of poison
She gave me all that I desired
Sung the songs of angel choirs
Preached the words of death and fire and left me burning

I gave her my heart, she didn't want it
Took it anyway and put a dark spell on it
Since then I haven't been the same
Needed a victim and she got it
Took me in with her song, powerless to stop it
Some men don't dare to speak her name

She sleeps beneath the surface
Consorting with the serpents
She strikes without a purpose

Sat on the stack, held it all back
Let it all go to prevent a crack
And it seems I miss you dearly

Youth on my side so I'll find the time
I'll grow up someday but for now I'm fine
I just wish that you were near me

Glory days, oh glory days behind me
Set deep but tainted skin
I'm well aware so don't remind me how I can't seem to win

Accept defeat but curse the cracks up empty streets
And I don't wanna tell the same sad story
Even if I did you'd just ignore me

I wear myself out trying to find an ending
And I'll work this out when I stop pretending
That I could never let this go
There's more to life than chasing ghosts
But then hindsight's 20/20

My old man once said, "Take heed
Don't wait until you're just like me
To look back over history with nothing but regret."

So all my friends say "Fuck forever. Live today and die together."
We don't wanna tell the same sad story
Heard it all before and that's fucking boring

I wear myself out trying to find an ending
And I'll work this out when I stop pretending
That I could never let this go
There's more to life than chasing ghosts
But then hindsight's 20/20

I wear myself out trying to find an ending
And I'll work this out when I stop pretending
That I could never let this go
There's more to life than chasing ghosts
But then hindsight's 20/20

Stumbled around the block a thousand times
You missed every call that I had tried
So now I'm giving up
A heartbreak in mid-December
You don't give a fuck
You never remember me
While you're pulling on his jeans
Getting lost in the big city
I was looking out our window
Watching all the cars go
Wondering if I'll see Chicago
Or a sunset on the West Coast
Or will I die in the cold
Feeling blue and alone
I wonder if you'll ever hear this song on your stereo

I hope you get your ball room floor
Your perfect house with rose red doors
I'm the last thing you'd remember
It's been a long, lonely December
I wish I'd known that less is more
But I was passed out on the floor
That's the last thing I remember
It's been a long, lonely December

Cast me aside to show yourself in a better light
I came out grieving, barely breathing and you came out alright
But I'm sure you'll take his hand
I hope he's better than I ever could have been
My mistakes were not intentions this is a list of my confessions I couldn't say

Pain is never permanent but tonight it's killing me

I hope you get your ball room floor
Your perfect house with rose red doors
I'm the last thing you'd remember
It's been a long, lonely December
I wish I'd known that less is more
But I was passed out on the floor
That's the last thing I remember
It's been a long, lonely December

I miss your face, you're in my head
There's so many things that I should have said
A year of suffering, a lesson learned
I miss your face, you're in my head
There's so many things that I should have said
A year of suffering, a lesson learned

I hope you get your ball room floor
Your perfect house with rose red doors
I'm the last thing you'd remember
It's been a long, lonely December
I wish I'd known that less is more
But I was passed out on the floor
That's the last thing I remember
It's been a long, lonely December

The leaves fell off as I did
Guess it held some kind of meaning
I've been lying in this bed of nails
Let the wind out of my sails
She left me on the bridge she's burning
Hell, maybe I deserve it
I'm just trying to find my purpose
I hope that it's all worth it

And there will come a time
When you will face your life
Don't let it twist and tear you up inside

The world's a fucked up place
But it depends on how you see it
Life is full of change
You grow up and then you feel it
Smooth seas don't make good sailors
Jump ship and head for failure
Find yourself a tragedy
Slowly lose your sanity

I'll be alright
The bark was worse than your bite
Left a scar that faded with time
Echo'd out to the back of my mind

And there will come a time
When you will face

The world's a fucked up place
But it depends on how you see it
Life is full of change
You grow up and then you feel it
Smooth seas don't make good sailors
Jump ship and head for failure
Find yourself a tragedy
Slowly lose your sanity

And after walking round in circles
Cursed every corner of this town will I make it out?
And if I do then it's a god send
I caught a bullet in between my teeth
Could this finally be the end?

And there will come a time
When you will face your life
Don't let it twist and tear you up inside

The world's a fucked up place
But it depends on how you see it
Life is full of change
You grow up and then you feel it
Smooth seas don't make good sailors
Jump ship and head for failure
Find yourself a tragedy
Slowly lose your sanity
Find yourself a tragedy
Slowly lose your sanity

I sat inside with a heavy heart
Just wish you would think of me
Are you listening?
Ran round in circles ‘til after dark
Didn't get very far
Wasn't meant to be
I never thought it would be this hard
It feels like you walked through me
I hope this comes back to haunt you
I hope this comes back to haunt you

Then maybe you would know just how it felt to be like me at my lowest
As you let me out the door, you tore me open
My final words were left unspoken

Told myself that this would be the last time you kept me awake
Some day you'll see, then it's too little too late
I wasn't good enough for you, and then you just stopped trying
What can I say?

I hope this comes back to haunt you
I hope this comes back to haunt you
I hope this comes back to haunt you

Told myself that this would be the last time you kept me awake
Some day you'll see, then you'll be stuck in this place
I wasn't good enough for you, and then you just stopped trying
What can I say?

And everyday that's passing is surely mine to seize
Did every wave that crashed in leave you washed up at her feet?

Wake up, the world seems bright out today
Life goes on, and things they change
Hands up if you've been left bruised and broken
Say "I'll be ok, I'll be ok"
Wake up, the world seems bright out today
Life goes on, and things they change
Hands up if you've been left bruised and broken
Say "I'll be ok, I'll be ok"
Wake up, the world seems bright out today
Life goes on, and things they change
Hands up if you've been left bruised and broken
Say "I'll be ok, I'll be ok"
Wake up, the world seems bright out today
Life goes on, and things they change
Hands up if you've been left bruised and broken
Say "I'll be ok, I'll be ok"

Dancing on the grave you made to hide me
Remove the pictures from the wall 'cause they're reminding
You of all the things you try so hard to hide and
She digs the graves so she knows just where she can find it
And I don't have much to offer
But had you loved me, I'd have loved you back forever

Here I am again, rock bottom
Dug this hole to hell to rot in
Shouldn't've ignored my friends
It frayed the rope that they had dropped in
Here I lay again, rock bottom
What was life? I've long forgotten
How the sun felt on my skin
Resurrect and start again

She said, "You're distant from the world and self-destructive"
But she still smiles and laughs along for self-indulgence
She's got her finger on the pulse and she feels nothing
She digs the graves so she can dance like no one's watching
And I know you're chasing something
Or has what you wanted got you scared and running?
And I know you're missing something
Because I felt it there that night and caught you blushing

Here I am again, rock bottom
Dug this hole to hell to rot in
Shouldn't've ignored my friends
It frayed the rope that they had dropped in
Here I lay again, rock bottom
What was life? I've long forgotten
How the sun felt on my skin
Resurrect and start again

The ebb and flow of life's a mystery
So I guess I'll never know
Yeah, I got caught up in history
So I think it's time for me to let this go
The ebb and flow of life's a mystery
So I guess I'll never know
Yeah, I got caught up in history
So I think it's time for me to let this go

Here I am again, rock bottom
Dug this hole to hell to rot in
Shouldn't've ignored my friends
It frayed the rope that they had dropped in
Here I lay again, rock bottom
What was life? I've long forgotten
How the sun felt on my skin
Resurrect and start again
Resurrect and start again
Resurrect and start again
